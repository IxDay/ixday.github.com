      <description>Another post on Terraform. Here to share a little snippet to retrieve some data from your Terraform state. When you are dealing with some Terraform resources or writing modules you may encounter the sensitive keyword/value (here is a bit of doc). This is handy to avoid leaking some data, but from time to time you may want to extract one of those.
Code For this article let&amp;rsquo;s imagine I am creating an aws_iam_user for another team to access some specific resources.</description>

      <description>How to easily debug Terraform? This was one of my biggest problem when dealing with the tool. I followed instructions to use some output ressources or browse the &amp;ldquo;debug&amp;rdquo; logs. Disclaimer: none of it was working properly.
So here is what I am actually doing and I am perfectly happy with. Oh! And just before starting to enable debug logs you have to pass the environment variable TF_LOG=debug (because there is no man page and it is not written in the --help content).</description>

      <description>A quick post to present one of my finding during my Kubernetes journey. It may help people since it took me some time to find this out. I am currently using Kubernetes a lot for my job. I am part of the infrastructure team and need to debug some setups. I am using kubectl logs extensively and I found a few interesting options I&amp;rsquo;d like to share.
Most of the time you will have multiple containers handling requests and you want to see what is happening in all of them.</description>

      <description>Why this project I am currently using gopass to store and share my passwords. I was relying on GPG to handle the encryption side of the process. Then a colleague of mine introduced me to age. This encryption specification allows the use of SSH keys and specifically the ED25519 ones. I decided to make the switch and moved all my stores to age encryption.
I am protecting my private key with a password and only loading it inside my agent.</description>

      <description>I already did an article around Golang and SSH previously, since it is a huge part of my current work. Today, I will share a small snippet which can be quite handy when automating stuff. This is how to perform a SSH tunnel using Golang. I will not explain what it is or what it is useful for, if you need more details please check the doc. In this tutorial, I will use the official SSH library from Google.</description>

      <description>For most of my infrastructure, I am now using Alpine Linux. I like it because it only has a small number of moving parts. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to know and master them, it is making my life easier :).
So, I decided to install one on my VPS. Like my distro I wanted it to be simple and small. For all those reasons I went for Wireguard. The fact that it is the new cool kid, may also have helped.</description>

I added the magical set -x line at the beginning to understand what was going on.</description>

      <description>From time to time you write some code to deal with data that will be stored somewhere on a drive. When debugging it may be nice to have &amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; commands to mimic code and help understanding what is going on.
When it comes to encryption the swiss army knife you will most probably have in your shell environment is openssl. But reading and understanding the documentation can sometimes be &amp;ldquo;challenging&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Golang SSH, marshalling, unmarshalling</title>

      <description>Golang is a wonderful language to deal with the SSH protocol. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly due to the SSH library which is pretty exhaustive.
However, when I had to deal with external requirements like SSH Agent or OpenSSH I experienced a lack of example and struggled a bit interfacing.
In this article we will see how to exchange keys between a program written in Go and those tools using files. This means to output our keys in a proper format (marshaling) and being able to read them (unmarshalling) from the external tool format.</description>

      <description>A pretty good security advice would be to never write down a password unencrypted on disk. This can be pretty tricky to achieve, especially on personal and development environments. So let me introduce gopass which is a tool aiming to help with this problem.
First of all, let me say it right away, the CLI interface is not that good. Took me a lot of time to set things properly as options may be cryptic and behavior is not obvious as first sight.</description>

      <description>Lately, I decided to re-install my old Raspberry Pi (version 1, yes I&amp;rsquo;m that old) to create a small home server. Since I am using Alpine and liking it quite a lot, I wanted to install it on my new little toy project.
I followed documentations and tutorials ( here and here) and finally succeeded. I am now writing it down so I remember what has been achieved.
Setup SD Card This one was quite tricky because if anything is not exactly what is expected your raspberry will never boot!</description>

      <description>This post is a simple copy of this answer, go there to see the original.
As I am using git extensively in my day to day life/job, I encountered the issue to simply amend a commit which is already two or three commits before the current one.
I could use git rebase -i with some stashing to apply the changes at the proper moment. This is most of the time a viable solution, however, it may be complicated because I have too much new code and stashing would be complicated.</description>

      <description>This post is only to present a small project and the reasons behind it. Hope it can help other people.
Why this project I am massively using jq in my shell scripts to deal with APIs. It is a powerfull tool and really help my day to day work. A few weeks ago I had to do the same kind of operations on a Yaml file, I started looking out there for alternative, and found some tooling which are translating Yaml to Json then push it to jq: here is an example.</description>

      <description>Golang implementation of a simple logger is subject to some criticism. First, it does not use any extendable pattern, the only interface we can inject to modify the behavior of the logger is a writer interface. Also, the lack of a proper log level control is a subject of discussion in the community here, here, or this blog post.
This post is more a reflexion around APIs and tricks in Golang than a production ready package.</description>

      <description>From time to time in go I have to start multiple small services acting in parallel. For example, a ssh server tied to an administration console (one is running on port 80 the other on port 22), or a kafka consumer pushing to a database and a website to serve those informations. You can decouple this in multiple programs, or run them through some kind of a manager and handle everything at the same place.</description>

If you are going over a directory, and return filepath.SkipDir error on a file entry. The walker will stop.
Setup directory First, set up a simple directory to walk
mkdir -p foo/baz touch foo/bar touch foo/baz/qux Run the script Now, let&amp;rsquo;s run this example script, with the previous directory as the entry argument. I will reuse the example from golang documentation website with small changes.</description>

Then, a few days later, I was coding on a toy project and I was doing some stuff around the io package to copy huge files. I wanted to achieve copy cancelation during the processing, basically, being able to interrupt.</description>

      <description>I recently discovered the direnv project. Which helped me a lot for setting up my development environments. I will share a bit of things I use in my daily basis.
Python projects This is well documented but here is what I use in python projects to set up a default virtualenv.
layout python That&amp;rsquo;s it! It sets up a virtualenv in your .direnv directory, and load the updated PATH.
Golang projects This one is a bit trickier.</description>

      <description>A feature I like in golang is the hability to declare a variable at the assignation time. Something like this:
foo := &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; Here the variable foo will automatically set up as a string with the value &amp;ldquo;bar&amp;rdquo;. One more feature is to be able to allocate on same line as doing a comparison. Like this:
if foo := &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34;; foo == &amp;#34;baz&amp;#34; { // do something } else { // do something else } This is really handy when it comes to catch errors from an other function:</description>

curl -si &amp;lt;ip&amp;gt; # -s is the silent flag, it removes the progress # -i displays the headers curl -X POST -H &amp;#34;Content-Type: application/json&amp;#34; -u &amp;#34;admin:admin&amp;#34; -d &amp;#39;{}&amp;#39; &amp;lt;ip&amp;gt; # -X set up the http method (here POST) # -H set up an header, format is: &amp;#34;header_name: value&amp;#34; # -u support for Basic Auth, format is: &amp;#34;user:password&amp;#34; # -d set up data to send to the server I mostly use those options, the -s is really interesting when you want to grep the content.</description>

      <description>I will not install VirtualBox! That&amp;rsquo;s all (nor VMWare, don&amp;rsquo;t be ridiculous). But I really like Vagrant, and use it every time I need something closer to a running machine. So, I dig up the internet and found that there is an unofficial support of libvirt.
Installation I do not remember where I found the documentation to do this or if I did it by myself, so no link here, just what I do in order to make this work.</description>

      <description>Jenkins is everywhere now, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t like it. So I am looking at a replacement from day to day. I discovered Gogs an I though that a CI is also a good use case for the Golang language.
And I finally found Drone (which was not really difficult as it is mentionned in a ticket on gogs github).
So I decided to make them work together in order to test that.</description>

      <description>Recently Nodejs environment broke due the removal from npm of a small library (11 SLOC): leftpad. As it hit the world and broke a bunch of projects and CIs, I asked myself if my projects contains so much dependencies that if one break, everything collapse.
The problem For developing my frontend I use a tool which I really like: Gulp. The issue there, is that for working with multiple building process involved a lot of glue and third party libraries.</description>

      <description>I have recently dug into pytest documentation, and moreover into the command line arguments and I finally found a better workflow for running tests while I develop.
Here is the command I run when I just made some devs: py.test -xvvvs --tb=line --pdb
 -x will stop execution on first failue, useful when debugging tests in order of appearance (recommended) -vvv will display current test path (reuasable in py.test), the path will avoid to rerun all the previous tests before going to the one you are currently working on.</description>

      <description>After a long journey, I finally found the distribution which fits all my need: Linux Mint Debian Edition
Why ?  It is based on debian a distribution which I really like (and not Ubuntu). The default tilling (similar to W7) is really comfortable. Lot of configuration can be done for shortcuts. Support for systemd (Yay \o/). Beautiful UI out of the box (which I didn&amp;rsquo;t have with TWM). And a lot more  Installation As I am on Macbook (once upon a time, I was young and dumb), I need a particular configuration of the partitions for the installation.</description>

And I recently discovered Ansible, which is a tool for doing a lot of stuff with a server (configuration, run repetitive command, installation) over ssh.
I really loved experienced with it, it does not require a lot of dependencies on the targeted server, and can be easily run.</description>

Preparation First of all install xmobar, apt-get install xmobar/testing. Here I will use testing because I need the multiple fonts support, see here for the release note.
The second thing I will need is an iconic font for the power button. Font Awesome fits my need.</description>

I have LVM on top of Luks for my system.
When I boot I encounter the following message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;  Volume group &amp;#34;vg_ssd&amp;#34; not found

Unable to find LVM volume vg_ssd/lv_root
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that LVM is started before I open the crypted partition and display this error.
To fix this we will manipulate the initramfs \o/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is in the file &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-top/cryptroot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But Weechat have one major issue: IT IS NOT USER FRIENDLY. The documentation is poor, there is a lot of plugins, which documentation is even poorer, and the configuration is a hell.
WELCOME!
First of all the installation, apt-get install weechat will be sufficient on a real OS. Then, just type weechat in order to launch the client.</description>

I tried a lot of things but they never worked as I wanted them to. So, I decided to do this by myself.
Specifications Here are the features I wanted:

      <description>When developing on a project it is possible that a dependency can have an issue. First you want to be able to debug it (pdb, ipdb), then modify it if you find a bug. To do that there is a naive way in python, which consist in editing directly the sources of the module. But there is a cleaner way based on pip.
The -e option allows you to pass a path (git, http, file) for a given module and link it to your environment.</description>

The repo is available here

  no evaluation for environment variables

At some point I had to tests promises, and more generally testing that some part of a function is not called (you will have to adapt the snippet but the idea is here).

The service $parse is the one who runs on the html to bind data with your javascript. It provides a lot of useful features which can be really interesting especially with directive manipulation.

      <description>There are some cases when angular is accessible but we just want to access a specific service without bootstraping an entire application.
For example, in some tests I can load some fixtures with the $http service, or use $compile for a simple template.
It is pretty simple to do that, but it is not clearly explained in the angular documentation. So here is an example:

You can find here a good generator for what you want. But sometimes, having a snippet in the bash prompt can be needed.
So here is an example:
