      <description>This post is a simple copy of this answer, go there to see the original.
As I am using git extensively in my day to day life/job, I encountered the issue to simply amend a commit which is already two or three commits before the current one.
I could use git rebase -i with some stashing to apply the changes at the proper moment. This is most of the time a viable solution, however, it may be complicated because I have too much new code and stashing would be complicated.</description>
