      <description>Another post on Terraform. Here to share a little snippet to retrieve some data from your Terraform state. When you are dealing with some Terraform resources or writing modules you may encounter the sensitive keyword/value (here is a bit of doc). This is handy to avoid leaking some data, but from time to time you may want to extract one of those.
Code For this article let&amp;rsquo;s imagine I am creating an aws_iam_user for another team to access some specific resources.</description>

      <description>How to easily debug Terraform? This was one of my biggest problem when dealing with the tool. I followed instructions to use some output ressources or browse the &amp;ldquo;debug&amp;rdquo; logs. Disclaimer: none of it was working properly.
So here is what I am actually doing and I am perfectly happy with. Oh! And just before starting to enable debug logs you have to pass the environment variable TF_LOG=debug (because there is no man page and it is not written in the --help content).</description>
