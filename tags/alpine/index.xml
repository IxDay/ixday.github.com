      <description>I have Kubernetes at home. I use it for my own infrastructure and my own server. I will maybe start a series of post about it in the future. However, today I will speak about a really specific issue I ran into.
For my Kubernetes cluster I needed to deploy a monitoring stack. I am using the now standard prometheus + grafana (and some others services) to handle this. To monitor my host machine I am using the node exporter project in a daemon-set and mount the entire host system in it so it can be monitored.</description>

      <title>Wireguard on a Linux Alpine with Docker</title>

      <description>For most of my infrastructure, I am now using Alpine Linux. I like it because it only has a small number of moving parts. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to know and master them, it is making my life easier :).
So, I decided to install one on my VPS. Like my distro I wanted it to be simple and small. For all those reasons I went for Wireguard. The fact that it is the new cool kid, may also have helped.</description>
