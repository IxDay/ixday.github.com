      <description>I have Kubernetes at home. I use it for my own infrastructure and my own server. I will maybe start a series of post about it in the future. However, today I will speak about a really specific issue I ran into.
For my Kubernetes cluster I needed to deploy a monitoring stack. I am using the now standard prometheus + grafana (and some others services) to handle this. To monitor my host machine I am using the node exporter project in a daemon-set and mount the entire host system in it so it can be monitored.</description>

      <description>A quick post to present one of my finding during my Kubernetes journey. It may help people since it took me some time to find this out. I am currently using Kubernetes a lot for my job. I am part of the infrastructure team and need to debug some setups. I am using kubectl logs extensively and I found a few interesting options I&amp;rsquo;d like to share.
Most of the time you will have multiple containers handling requests and you want to see what is happening in all of them.</description>
