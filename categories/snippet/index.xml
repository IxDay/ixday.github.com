      <description>Another post on Terraform. Here to share a little snippet to retrieve some data from your Terraform state. When you are dealing with some Terraform resources or writing modules you may encounter the sensitive keyword/value (here is a bit of doc). This is handy to avoid leaking some data, but from time to time you may want to extract one of those.
Code For this article let&amp;rsquo;s imagine I am creating an aws_iam_user for another team to access some specific resources.</description>

      <description>A quick post to present one of my finding during my Kubernetes journey. It may help people since it took me some time to find this out. I am currently using Kubernetes a lot for my job. I am part of the infrastructure team and need to debug some setups. I am using kubectl logs extensively and I found a few interesting options I&amp;rsquo;d like to share.
Most of the time you will have multiple containers handling requests and you want to see what is happening in all of them.</description>

      <description>I already did an article around Golang and SSH previously, since it is a huge part of my current work. Today, I will share a small snippet which can be quite handy when automating stuff. This is how to perform a SSH tunnel using Golang. I will not explain what it is or what it is useful for, if you need more details please check the doc. In this tutorial, I will use the official SSH library from Google.</description>

      <description>From time to time you write some code to deal with data that will be stored somewhere on a drive. When debugging it may be nice to have &amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; commands to mimic code and help understanding what is going on.
When it comes to encryption the swiss army knife you will most probably have in your shell environment is openssl. But reading and understanding the documentation can sometimes be &amp;ldquo;challenging&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Golang is a wonderful language to deal with the SSH protocol. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly due to the SSH library which is pretty exhaustive.
However, when I had to deal with external requirements like SSH Agent or OpenSSH I experienced a lack of example and struggled a bit interfacing.
In this article we will see how to exchange keys between a program written in Go and those tools using files. This means to output our keys in a proper format (marshaling) and being able to read them (unmarshalling) from the external tool format.</description>

      <description>This post is a simple copy of this answer, go there to see the original.
As I am using git extensively in my day to day life/job, I encountered the issue to simply amend a commit which is already two or three commits before the current one.
I could use git rebase -i with some stashing to apply the changes at the proper moment. This is most of the time a viable solution, however, it may be complicated because I have too much new code and stashing would be complicated.</description>

      <description>From time to time in go I have to start multiple small services acting in parallel. For example, a ssh server tied to an administration console (one is running on port 80 the other on port 22), or a kafka consumer pushing to a database and a website to serve those informations. You can decouple this in multiple programs, or run them through some kind of a manager and handle everything at the same place.</description>

      <description>During the development of a small project I noticed something strange with golang&amp;rsquo;s function filepath.Walk.
If you are going over a directory, and return filepath.SkipDir error on a file entry. The walker will stop.
Setup directory First, set up a simple directory to walk
mkdir -p foo/baz touch foo/bar touch foo/baz/qux Run the script Now, let&amp;rsquo;s run this example script, with the previous directory as the entry argument. I will reuse the example from golang documentation website with small changes.</description>

      <description>I recently came across this video on Golang programming. I think this was the moment I finally fully understood the power of Go. It is smart, simple and elegant, I love it.
Then, a few days later, I was coding on a toy project and I was doing some stuff around the io package to copy huge files. I wanted to achieve copy cancelation during the processing, basically, being able to interrupt.</description>

      <description>I recently discovered the direnv project. Which helped me a lot for setting up my development environments. I will share a bit of things I use in my daily basis.
Python projects This is well documented but here is what I use in python projects to set up a default virtualenv.
layout python That&amp;rsquo;s it! It sets up a virtualenv in your .direnv directory, and load the updated PATH.
Golang projects This one is a bit trickier.</description>

      <description>A feature I like in golang is the hability to declare a variable at the assignation time. Something like this:
foo := &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; Here the variable foo will automatically set up as a string with the value &amp;ldquo;bar&amp;rdquo;. One more feature is to be able to allocate on same line as doing a comparison. Like this:
if foo := &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34;; foo == &amp;#34;baz&amp;#34; { // do something } else { // do something else } This is really handy when it comes to catch errors from an other function:</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER: This is now fixed in git new releases and does not need to be done anymore. I use an old version of alpine in order to have an unpached version of git.
I ran into an interesting issue lastly. I wanted to mount a volume inside a container and clone a repo in it. I also wanted to avoid messing with the permissions and pass my user to the container as well.</description>

      <description>Recently, I had to build some project involving a lot of files. Two choices were possible:
 use a script to build use a Makefile  I ended up with a Makefile, which is the best solution I think. As the script has to generate a bunch of files from &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; files. (I have to confess also, I have been a bit influenced by jessfraz with those tweets: here and here)</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t want to use Docker? Still want to start containers for tests or whatever? Don&amp;rsquo;t want to install yet another software to perform this? Want to understand a bit of how all those things work? Great! I will show you how to boot a container from the internet only through systemd-nspawn
Thanks to the CoreOS team (love those guys) a new hub for storing container now exists: quay. The other good news is the ACI, the container image format defined in the App Container (appc) spec.</description>

      <description>Here are some options and command I use with curl when dealing with stuff I have to develop.
curl -si &amp;lt;ip&amp;gt; # -s is the silent flag, it removes the progress # -i displays the headers curl -X POST -H &amp;#34;Content-Type: application/json&amp;#34; -u &amp;#34;admin:admin&amp;#34; -d &amp;#39;{}&amp;#39; &amp;lt;ip&amp;gt; # -X set up the http method (here POST) # -H set up an header, format is: &amp;#34;header_name: value&amp;#34; # -u support for Basic Auth, format is: &amp;#34;user:password&amp;#34; # -d set up data to send to the server I mostly use those options, the -s is really interesting when you want to grep the content.</description>

      <description>Jenkins is everywhere now, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t like it. So I am looking at a replacement from day to day. I discovered Gogs an I though that a CI is also a good use case for the Golang language.
And I finally found Drone (which was not really difficult as it is mentionned in a ticket on gogs github).
So I decided to make them work together in order to test that.</description>

      <description>Recently Nodejs environment broke due the removal from npm of a small library (11 SLOC): leftpad. As it hit the world and broke a bunch of projects and CIs, I asked myself if my projects contains so much dependencies that if one break, everything collapse.
The problem For developing my frontend I use a tool which I really like: Gulp. The issue there, is that for working with multiple building process involved a lot of glue and third party libraries.</description>

      <description>I have recently dug into pytest documentation, and moreover into the command line arguments and I finally found a better workflow for running tests while I develop.
Here is the command I run when I just made some devs: py.test -xvvvs --tb=line --pdb
 -x will stop execution on first failue, useful when debugging tests in order of appearance (recommended) -vvv will display current test path (reuasable in py.test), the path will avoid to rerun all the previous tests before going to the one you are currently working on.</description>

echo something/{foo,bar} &amp;gt; something/foo something/bar Still not amazed, ok now type this one:

      <description>Jasmine is a good testing framework, which I really like, it is really powerfull and has just the amount of features to perform a huge variety of tests.
At some point I had to tests promises, and more generally testing that some part of a function is not called (you will have to adapt the snippet but the idea is here).
It is pretty simple, but not well known (I checked some stackoverflow threads before finding this).</description>

      <description>Sometimes we only need to have a boilerplate quickly to test it through a browser. We only want to have the basis, and having it working fine.
You can find here a good generator for what you want. But sometimes, having a snippet in the bash prompt can be needed.
So here is an example:
# stop script if something bad happen set -e # unzip need to have a tempfile to extract properly TMPFILE=&amp;#34;/tmp/tempfile.</description>
