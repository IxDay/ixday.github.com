A pretty good security advice would be to never write down a password unencrypted
on disk. This can be pretty tricky to achieve, especially on personal and development
environments. So let me introduce [gopass](https://www.gopass.pw/docs/)
which is a tool aiming to help with this problem.

First of all, let me say it right away, the CLI interface is not that good.
Took me a lot of time to set things properly as options may be cryptic and
behavior is not obvious as first sight.

Installation and getting started
--------------------------------

Just follow the instruction from the official website. It should be packaged
for your distribution as it is now pretty popular. If not, installation is
pretty straightforward as it is a single binary. Do not forget to also install
[gpg](https://gnupg.org/) it's a hard dependency and potentially
[git](https://git-scm.com/) (even though a git implementation is shipped with the project).

Run `gopass init` to set up your environment. It should now be ready to use!

Once this is done, checkout the [cheatsheet](https://woile.github.io/gopass-cheat-sheet/)
as it contains good documentation and examples for usage of `gopass`.

Set up stores for organizations and teams
-----------------------------------------

Initialization is pretty simple:

```bash
# creates a store named `foo` using binary embedded git implementation
gopass init --path ~/.local/share/password-store/foo --store foo

# you can then connect it to a remote git repository
gopass git remote add --store foo origin git@rulz.xyz/keys.git

# go to the directory and manually push, going through gopass cli is flacky
cd  ~/.local/share/password-store/foo && git push origin HEAD:master && cd -

# you can now sync the repo throught the cli
gopass sync
```

If you need to clone an existing one:

```bash
gopass clone --path ~/.local/share/password-store/foo git@rulz.xyz/keys.git foo
```

Gopass and curl
---------------

Using [netrc](https://brandur.org/fragments/gpg-curl) support from `curl` and
[binary encoding](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass/blob/master/docs/features.md#support-for-binary-content)
in gopass, we can run basic access authentication without leaking the password:

```bash
# first save the file (password will never hit the hdd here)
cat << EOF |
machine rulz.xyz
login my_username
password $(stty -echo; read p; echo "$p"; stty echo)
EOF
gopass binary cat rulz_netrc

# you can now use curl and pipe the secret to it
gopass show rulz/netrc | base64 -d |
	curl --netrc-file /dev/stdin -fsSL https://rulz.xyz/secrets/raw/branch/master/README.md
```

Gopass and direnv
-----------------

Another thing you can do is to link it with your direnv environment
([I wrote a post about it](/post/direnv/)).
This will inject development password into environment variables, only for your
the current directory and without the risk of committing them accidentally.

Here is an example of an `.envrc` file:

```bash
export FOO=BAR
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(gopass show foo/aws)
```

That's all for me folks! If I find other use cases, will try to post them.
