For most of my personal infrastructure I am now using [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/).
I like it because it only has a small number of moving parts. It's easy to
know and master them, making my life better :).

So, I decided to install on one of my VPS a VPN. Like my distro I wanted it to
be simple and small. For all those reasons I went for [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/).
The fact that it is the new cool kid, may also have helped.
