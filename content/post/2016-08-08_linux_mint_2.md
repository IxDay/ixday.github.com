I recently messed up my laptop (do not play with `/etc/apt/preferences` too much!),
and I had to reinstall my distro. I checked my [previous article]({{< ref "2016-02-22_linux_mint.md" >}})
and noticed some missing informations. So here is a second article of things
I needed to fixup when installing LMDE on my Macbook.

## Installation

First, for the creation of the usb key, I ended up using the method described
in the [archlinux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media#In_GNU.2FLinux). Basically, this was the command line I entered:

```bash
dd bs=4M if=/path/to/lmde.iso of=/dev/sdb # /dev/sdb is my usb key (lsblk FTW)
```

Then, for the partitioning I forgot to tell the filesystem needed by each part,
so here is lsblk to the rescue:

```bash
$ sudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT
NAME               FSTYPE      MOUNTPOINT
sda
├─sda1             hfsplus
├─sda2             vfat        /boot/efi
├─sda3             ext4        /boot
└─sda4             LVM2_member
  ├─vg_ssd-lv_root ext4        /
  └─vg_ssd-lv_swap swap        [SWAP]
sdb                iso9660
├─sdb1             iso9660     /media/max/LMDE 2 Cinnamon 64-bit
└─sdb2             vfat
```

(sudo needed to output the fs, see `man lsblk` for more informations)

## Configuration

### Preferences

This time I will try to avoid messing up with the packages, here is what I have
done.

I want to add unstable and experimental repos, so I created a source file:
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-package-repositories.list`

```bash
# https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList

deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian sid main contrib non-free
deb-src http://httpredir.debian.org/debian sid main contrib non-free

deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian experimental main contrib non-free
deb-src http://httpredir.debian.org/debian experimental main contrib non-free
```

Now it is time to set up the preferences. But here is the trick, by default
Mint set up a Pin-Priority 700 to all the Debian packages.
This will bring unstable packages at the same level as those from stable.

See the file `/etc/apt/preferences.d/debian-package-repositories.pref`, in
order to have a good priority across those repos replace the content with:

```bash
Package: *
Pin: release a=stable
Pin-Priority: 550

Package: *
Pin: release a=unstable
Pin-Priority: 450
```

Now, just a `apt-get update` and we are ready to install packages safely

### Tearing

I had a tearing issue on my macbook, which I was able to spot and test with
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceX18O9pvLs).

I followed the instructions from the [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/intel_graphics#Tear-free_video). It makes me create `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf` file, and
fill it with:

```bash
Section "Device"
   Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
   Driver      "intel"
   Option      "AccelMethod"  "sna"
   Option      "TearFree"     "true"
   Option      "DRI"          "3"
EndSection
```

I restarted X (restart the computer in order to be sure :p), and it now works
(hopefully).

### Webcam

I had issues with my webcam too. [I followed archwiki again](
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBook#Webcam). This one is not
confirmed but no command failed, and the test with mplayer at the end seemed
to work:

```bash
mplayer tv:// -tv driver=v4l2:width=320:height=240:device=/dev/video0 -fps 30
```


## Programs

### Neovim

I replaced `vim` with `neovim`, and put all the configuration in the
`.config/nvim` directory. It works out of the box, without changing a thing in
the configuration, except the paths for the plugins (which were in `~/.vim`).

To install `neovim` you will need the experimental packages described in
the first part of this post.

### Golang

I wanted Golang 1.6 (not the 1.3 version from stable). So, I read the
documentation and asked forum. And I discovered the `-t` option in `apt-get`
which allows as long as it does not broke package integrity to install
from different versions.

I simply typed the following command to have the version needed:

`apt-get install -t unstable golang`

### Docker

Docker is available in the unstable repository, but this one broke some other
dependencies. I had to install it with a custom repo following
[those instructions](https://gist.github.com/bhgraham/ed9f8242dc610b1f38e5).

```bash
# Add the repo to a dedicated source.list file
echo "deb https://get.docker.com/ubuntu docker main" > \
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

# Add repo keyring
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys \
       36A1D7869245C8950F966E92D8576A8BA88D21E9

# Update and install the package
apt-get update -qq && sudo apt-get install -y lxc-docker

# Add my user to the docker group
gpasswd -a <my_user_name> docker

# Enable the docker service for the next start
systemctl enable docker
```

Now logout, and reconnect and it should work.

### Python

I always need some base packages in order to start developing, so those are
the most basic one I need in my daily life:

`apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev virtualenv libyaml-dev`

(be sure to install the `virtualenv` package and not the `python-virtualenv` one,
because it will not add the binary to the `PATH`).
