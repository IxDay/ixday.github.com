I recently discovered [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and I really liked it.
You just have to add a script tag and you can start coding using this framework.

After a few hours of development, I decided to use [SFC (Single File Components)](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html) to separate business code from components.
And I got a really bad surpise! In order to compile those templates I needed
to use a build system (Webpack or Browserify). The tutorial is really good, but...

**GOD I DON'T WANT TO INSTALL 200MB OF DEPENDENCIES AND WRITE 200+SLOC BUILD
FILE.**

I need to keep things simple, I don't need Babel, I know how to write JS. I can
rant on this for hours. I started looking around for an alternative solution.
And found [this interesting thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/vuejs/comments/5ops4d/light_weight_and_simple_way_to_use_single_file/). So no simple solution out there.

This is why I started [vuecc project](https://github.com/BackInMyDays/vuecc).
It only depends on [html-minifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier)
and brings less than 3MB of dependencies.

Not everything is supported	but for the moment it fits my needs. Simple to use,
it outputs understandable javascript. I will surely add features when time will
come to support things like isolation or javascript compression.
