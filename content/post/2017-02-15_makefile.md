Recently, I had to build some project involving a lot of files. Two choices
were possible:

- use a script to build
- use a Makefile

I ended up with a Makefile, which is the best solution I think. As the script
has to generate a bunch of files from "source" files.
(I have to confess also, I have been a bit influenced by
 [jessfraz](https://twitter.com/jessfraz) with those tweets:

 [here](https://twitter.com/jessfraz/status/805846280547110912))

This project also learned me some tricks which can be reused, here is a little list

### Default variable

You can set a default value to an internal variable of a makefile. Those variables
can be set up at the `make` command run i.e: `make ARCH=i686` or `ARCH=i686 make`
```make
SERVER_PORT ?= 5050
ARCH ?= amd64
```


### Watch all files from a directory to change

This is perfectly correct and usable in a Makefile

```make
archive.tgz: $(shell find root -type f | sed 's/ /\\ /g')
	@tar cvzf $@ $^
```

**Note:** `$@` represent the target and `$^` all the file dependencies

### Define and use a command

You can define a command as a parameter and use it in a target, this is really
convenient and a huge plus against a shell script (which will require an eval
statement). You can nest variable inside your commands, this gives a lot of
flexibility.

```make
WGET = wget -d -o logfile

archive.tgz:
	$(WGET) -O "$@" "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-5.0.tar.gz"
```


### Use another makefile

We can use the makefile from another project within the current makefile, with
the `-C` option. In this example `$(MAKE)` is setup by default to `make` command.
The `$(dir ...)` part is a `make` internal command
(see [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/File-Name-Functions.html#File-Name-Functions))

```make
vendor/darkhttpd/darkhttpd_:
	$(MAKE) -C $(dir $@)
```

### Escape variable

Sometimes you need to escape the variable character, this can be done by doubling
it: `$$`. In the following example, the `$$2` will represent the `$2` from `awk`
and not a variable from `make`

```make
clean.virsh:
	virsh list | awk '$$2 ~ /ipxe/ {system("virsh destroy " $$2)}'
	virsh list --all | awk '$$2 ~ /ipxe/ {system("virsh undefine " $$2)}'
```

### Debug your targets

In order to debug your targets you can run a simple command which is not too
verbose, but display enough information though (got from the documentation
[here](http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/make3/book/ch12.pdf))

```bash
# Replace the <target> by the one you want to debug
make --debug=basic -n <target>
```

### That's all folks

I will try to improve this article over the time as I find new tips from `make`.
